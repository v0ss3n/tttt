# About

Michelle Vossen is an interactive textile designer and educator based in Utrecht and Amsterdam, NL. Her practice revolves around textiles and technology, researching the artisanal production of electronics components through textile crafts. She makes soft sensors with manual and mechanical textile techniques such as knitting, spinning, weaving and sewing and combines them with electronic components, microcontrollers and code to create interactive works that invite you to touch.

Opposing boring interaction with plastic buttons, smooth touchscreens and touchless interfaces, she makes tactile interfaces that instead focus on haptic exploration and movement using the entire body. These interactions are embodied, sonified and visualized, exploring alternatives to traditional music making and performance where the participation of the public is encouraged.
