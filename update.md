# How to update your t-t-t-t with the latest firmware
If you are on Windows, you probably need to install [this driver](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) first.

1. Download [this file](./assets/firmware/tttt-v2.bin)
2. Open [this page](https://esptool.spacehuhn.com/){:target="_blank"} in Google Chrome or Chromium (or Edge/Opera, but I didn't test those), otherwise it doesn't work
3. Plug in your t-t-t-t via USB
3. Click on CONNECT and click the top COM port
4. Click on ERASE and confirm
5. Upload the downloaded firmware, and write 0 in the field to the left of it
6. Click on PROGRAM and wait for the firmware to be uploaded to your t-t-t-t!
